X-Privacy
=========

Overview
--------

X-privacy initiates private browsing if it detects a server sending a `X-privacy: Private` header.

"I had this idea that for websites that report crime or child abuse, anonymity
is extremely important and a lot of people don't have a clue to start up a
Private Browsing session themselves [...]" (Philip Clarke)
